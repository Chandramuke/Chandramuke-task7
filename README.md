# Chandramuke-task7
Use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification on a 2D dataset. Train models with both linear and RBF kernels using Scikit-learn. Visualize decision boundaries, tune hyperparameters like C and gamma, and evaluate performance using cross-validation. Use NumPy and Matplotlib for data handling and plotting.
